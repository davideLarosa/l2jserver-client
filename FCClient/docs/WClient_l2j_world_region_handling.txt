
Sizes:

world = 32 * 32 regions numbering 0..31
top left of playable world is region 16_10 ?!
so playable world is in x 16..31 in z 10..31  ?!

1 region = 256 * 256 blocks
1 block = 8 * 8 cells
1 cell = 16 * 16 units in world coords


cell size:	16  units
block size:	128 units
region size:	32768 units
world size:	1048576 units


some observations:
in l2 two models stood nearly on the same spot, but the coordinates were quite different.

46243,41220,-3508
46251,41223,-3510 

they stood 8 units in x apart and it seemed like half a meter. could it be that a cell defines a meter or two, i.e. 16 or 8 units ~ 1 meters ?
that would mean the world would only be 64k or 131k meters wide and high. compare this to the speed of a char, how fast are they, how many units do they travel in a sec? what would this mean compared to the size?

256(blocks of a region)*(16 units) would be 4096 (the divisor for one region in units)


cell size:	1m
block size:	*8m
region size:	*256 = 2048m
world size:	*32 = 65536m

a regions dimension is 2048m * 2048m
a region consists of 8 * 8 tiles  (one tile 129x129 verts and 256x256m)
top left is 0/0 
top right is 15/0
bottom left is 0/15
bottom right is 15/15

a tile has terrain, navmesh, static low, static high, vegetation
tiles in 3x3 surrounding are fully loaded and at ful detail
tiles between 4x4 and 5x5 are at least low loaded and full is currently loading or loaded
tiles at 6x& could be prerendered graytones of static low + terrain (6 images of the terrain in each 6 directions)

8 tiles are one region 
32*8 tiles is the world tiles count in x (and in y)
so in 16/16 we have the tile 0/0,1/0,
