Navmesh for WClient

 128er size for block = 256 blocks for a region 
 256er size for block = 128 blocks for a region

center: 128 ring 1: 256 ring 2: 384 ring 3:512 (ring 4:640 ?)

if 8 units ~ 1 meter this would mean 128 would be just 16m, a region would be 4096m

all 2m a node -> 128 nodes will form a 256m patch

center: 256 ring 1: 512 ring2: 768 ring 3: 1024


actually:
all 4m a node -> 128 nodes will form a 512m patch

center: 512 ring 1: 1024 ring 2: 1536 ring 3: 2048

Break potential, display mesh can be scaled, navmesh not
for a navmesh only the final extent is important.
on asset creation the same mesh can be used for navmesh and display mesh. After export the display mesh can be scaled, breaking the similarities between navmesh and display mesh
