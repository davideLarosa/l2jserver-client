BUGS:
Investigate missing materials though material is peresent in data.jar
Feb 14, 2012 4:24:42 PM com.l2client.asset.AssetManager$1 call
Schwerwiegend: requested mats/pdwarfmwarrior/dwarfwarriorattachment.j3m was not found
DONE: reason was jme ogre loader has some issues with material loading on models

Investigate missing ent positioningcomponen, is it a concurrency situation? creation and move in very short milis?!?!
Feb 14, 2012 4:25:05 PM com.l2client.network.game.ServerPackets.MoveToLocation handlePacket
Schwerwiegend: No SimplePositioningComonent found with entity id 268465869, perhaps just create one?
ANALYSIS: timing problem, creation of entity has to be done early, so when a move packet comes everything is already created.
DONE: While receiving npc information on startup server can send also already move instructions for npcs around which are not send
      to the client, this is is mitigated by queuing moved if the positioning component is not registered so far and later on registration 
      moves are issued 

Troll model is different:
ERROR no JMEAnimationController on Model


A strange packet sequence with a 0 sized packet ?!?!?

ANALYSIS: GameHandler and LoginHanlder should be more modular, and state reentrant, currently not all errors are reported, this has to done more thoroughly


GUI BUG: pressing L inGame causes the list of abilities to flicker must press several times until visible or invisible.
DONE: if action and button released, (button released was missing)
GUI BUG: drop down boxes do not work properly, sometimes they loose focus when used with mouse.


name tags are not centered above the models
DONE

pelfmwarrior has also wood elf stuff on it (so a bow is additionally displayed)
TODO: replaced models, now the elf warrior is a dark elf warrior, switch back to raider and check again
